#### Pull request overview
1. Fork it ( http://github.com/my-github-username/geoblacklight/fork )

#### Merging Changes

- It is considered "poor from" to merge your own request.
- Please take the time to review the changes and get a sense of what is being changed. Things to consider:
  - Does the commit message explain what is going on?
  - Does the code changes have tests? _Not all changes need new tests, some changes are refactorings_
  - Do all new methods, modules, and classes have comments? Do changed methods, modules, and classes have comments?
  - Does the commit contain more than it should? Are two separate concerns being addressed in one commit?
  - Did the Travis tests complete successfully?
- If you are uncertain, bring other contributors into the conversation by creating a comment that includes their @username.
- If you like the pull request, but want others to chime in, create a +1 comment and tag a user.
